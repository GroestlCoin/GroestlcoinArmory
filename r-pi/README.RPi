In order to compile for Raspberry Pi, the following commands must be run from
the Armory root directory.

python r-pi/crosscompile.py setupcrosscompiler
python r-pi/crosscompile.py

The final file (armory_<armory version>_raspbian-armhf.tar.gz) may be loaded
onto a Raspberry Pi 1 or 2, unzipped, and executed or installed by running the
"armory" command.
