   - Fixed signing/broadcast failures on large transactions
        Due to a signature padding issue, 1-in-256 signatures was failing
        verification checks, leading Armory to abort the transaction.  This
        was most frequently observed in large transactions with 100+ sigs.

   - Fixed issue with multiple outgoing transactions
        Creating and broadcasting multiple transactions sequentially was
        causing issues when zero-confirmation change had to be used for
        subsequent transactions.  

   - Restored compatibility with Ubuntu 12.04 (GCC <4.7.3)
        Introduction of C++11 advanced features into the BlockDataManager
        in 0.93 made our Ubuntu builds incompatible with 12.04.  With this
        release, building on 12.04 still requires a bit of work, but our
        downloadable .deb packages installs on 12.04 again.  To build, see:
        http://askubuntu.com/questions/113291/how-do-i-install-gcc-4-7

   - Armory Daemon (armoryd) reliability fixes
        A variety of reliability issues with armoryd were resolved,
        primarily related to the new database and back-end introduced
        in 0.93 (primarily getledger and getledgersimple).

   - Multi-sig fee calculation fixed, warnings updated
        Multi-signature transaction creation code was not
        calculating and enforcing sane fees.  Many users inadvertantly
        tried to send transactions with no chance of success, and with
        no useful information when it did fail.  

   - Uses floating fee estimation via RPC call in auto-bitcoind mode
        When Armory is running Core in the background, it now uses
        Core's floating fee estimation capability to recommend
        acceptable fees to the user

   - Deterministic Signing
        Deterministic signing (RFC6979) was enabled by default in 0.93.1,
        but the command-line arguments were not hooked up to be able to
        disable it.  You can now use --enable-detsign or --disable-detsign
        to force the selection.
        
   - Fix for lockbox change addresses
        Lockbox transactions created with armoryd were sending change
        back to the lockbox, but without P2SH.  This is harmless, and
        Armory is smart enough to handle it gracefully, but unintended.
